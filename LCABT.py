# Problem3 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree (https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]



Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

Output: 3

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

Output: 5

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
