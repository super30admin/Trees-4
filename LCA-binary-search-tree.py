https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree
Did it run on leetcode: Yes
Did you face any problem: No

Time Complexity: 0(N)
Space Complexity: 0(H) recursive stack

Algorithm:
- Do a inorder traversal of the tree
- check if the one of the values is greater than root and other is smaller, then you have the 
LCA.
- if its not then you can go either left or either right based on the values.
