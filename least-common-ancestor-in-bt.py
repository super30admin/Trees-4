'''
Recursive approach:
- Start traversing the tree from the root node.
- If the current node itself is one of p or q, we would mark a variable mid as True and continue the search for the other node in the left and right branches.
- If either of the left or the right branch returns True, this means one of the two nodes was found below.
- If at any point in the traversal, any two of the three flags left, right or mid become True, this means we have found the lowest common ancestor for the nodes p and q.
