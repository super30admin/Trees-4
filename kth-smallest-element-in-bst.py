Approach 1: Recursive
- Start traversing the tree from the root node.
- If both the nodes p and q are in the right subtree, then continue the search with right subtree starting step 1.
- If both the nodes p and q are in the left subtree, then continue the search with left subtree starting step 1.
- If both step 2 and step 3 are not true, this means we have found the node which is common to node p's and q's subtrees. and hence we return this common node as the LCA.
TC: O(n); n = number of nodes
SC: O(n); for recursive stack

Approach 2: Iterative
The only difference is instead of recursively calling the function, we traverse down the tree iteratively. This is possible without using a stack or recursion since we don't need to backtrace to find the LCA node. In essence of it the problem is iterative, it just wants us to find the split point. The point from where p and q won't be part of the same subtree or when one is the parent of the other.

SC: O(1)
